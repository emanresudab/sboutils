Synopsis:
Packages are build and installed with installsbo, and removed with removesbo.
Local copies of a SlackBuilds repository are managed with sboutil, you'll need
to uncomment or add a repositry in /etc/sboutils/repositories then run

	sboutil --sync-repository

If running installsbo/sboutil yeilds a "No repository specified" error, you'll
need to specify which one you want to use in /etc/sboutils/repositories with
the instructions at the top of the file.

Package names are the category followed by a forward slash, then the program name (IE graphics/feh). If you aren't sure what category the program you want is
in, or aren't certain you have the name right, you can use

	sboutil --search <term>

to search the repository.

Make sure you read the manpages as well, this is only a brief explination.


Installation:
There are no package downloads yet, so to install you'll need to clone the repository and run makepkg.

	git clone https://github.com/emanresudab/sboutils
	cd sboutils
	yes | makepkg ../sboutils-1.0-noarch-notag.txz
	installpkg ../sboutils-1.0-noarch-notag.txz

If you do this as root you don't need to pipe yes in to makepkg.


Uninstallation:
Removing the sboutils package still leaves behind the logfile, any repositories. To completely remove any trace of sboutils from your computer, remove
directories

	/var/sboutils
	/var/log/sboutils

Uninstalling sboutils will not uninstall any SlackBuilds.

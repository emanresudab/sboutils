# /etc/sboutils/repositories

# To set the currently active repository (I.e. the repository automatically
# used when no --repository flag is supplied, append a * to the end of the
# line. Make sure the URL and * are seperated by some sort of whitespace.

# Any repository here will work, but sboutils will assume it's contents are
# correctly stored. Packages are looked for in the repository folder, so
# "desktop/screenfetch" is expanded to "$REPODIR/$REPONAME/desktop/screenfetch,
# where $REPONAME is the name of the active repository (see above), and
# $REPODIR is the value defined in /etc/sboutils/sboutils.conf

# Supported repo utilities are rsync and git, but if you know what you're doing
# it's easy to add in your own. If you do this, please consider opening up a
# pull request on the github page :)
